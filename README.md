# SkillMarketFHE

**SkillMarketFHE** is a privacy-preserving internal skill marketplace platform that enables employees to anonymously offer their skills and available time for short-term projects. Utilizing **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**, the system matches projects with encrypted skill profiles, while maintaining confidentiality for both employees and managers.

---

## Project Background

Organizations often struggle with effectively leveraging internal talent due to:

- **Privacy concerns**: Employees may hesitate to disclose skills or availability openly.  
- **Inefficient resource allocation**: Managers lack a secure, comprehensive overview of internal capabilities.  
- **Trust issues**: Direct sharing of availability and skill levels may lead to bias or favoritism.  
- **Cross-department coordination challenges**: Short-term projects often require rapid and confidential skill matching.

**SkillMarketFHE** addresses these challenges by:

- Allowing encrypted skill submissions that preserve employee anonymity.  
- Using FHE to perform secure computations for skill matching without revealing raw data.  
- Optimizing project staffing and resource allocation internally.  
- Supporting a transparent and fair system for internal talent utilization.

## How FHE is Applied

Fully Homomorphic Encryption enables secure processing of employee skill data:

- Employees submit encrypted profiles with skills, expertise levels, and available time.  
- Project requirements are also encrypted and compared against employee profiles securely.  
- FHE computation identifies the best matches without exposing individual employee data.  
- The system outputs aggregated suggestions for project allocation, ensuring privacy and fairness.

Benefits include:

- **Complete confidentiality**: Skill profiles and availability remain fully encrypted.  
- **Fair matching**: Project assignments are based on encrypted computations, free from bias.  
- **Internal efficiency**: Managers receive actionable insights without accessing sensitive employee data.  
- **Scalable and compliant**: Supports enterprise-level data privacy requirements.
